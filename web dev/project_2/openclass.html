        <p>Things get a bit more difficult once you reach the CSS stage. 
          Indeed, it takes work (and sometimes a few tricks)
           to obtain a result similar to the mockup. 
          I say "similar to" as you'll never obtain the same
           result to the nearest pixel.
          You need to grasp this clearly: the aim is to obtain 
          the closest possible result,
           without seeking perfection. Even if you obtain what 
           you consider to be "perfection" in 
           one browser, you can be sure that there'll be
            differences in another (older) browser or 
           on a computer other than yours. 
          We're thus just going to do our best and that will 
           already involve quite some work, as you'll see.
